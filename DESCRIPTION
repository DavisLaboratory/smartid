Description: This package enables automated selection of group specific
    signature, especially for rare population. The package is developed for
    generating specifc lists of signature genes based on Term Frequency-Inverse
    Document Frequency (TF-IDF) modified methods. It can also be used as a new
    gene-set scoring method or data transformation method. Multiple visualization
    functions are implemented in this package.

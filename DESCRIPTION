Description: This package enables automated selection of group specific signature,
    especially for rare population. The package is developed for generating
    specifc lists of signature genes based on TF-IDF modified methods. It can
    also be used as a new gene-set scoring method or data transformation method.
    Multiple visualization functions are implemented in this package.
